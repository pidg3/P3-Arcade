#Front-end Nanodegree Arcade Game: P3

This project is for P3 in the Udacity Nanodegree. 

Repository was cloned from the main Udacity one. 

I've re-written the comments - I thought this would be helpful in making sure I understood what the Udacity code was doing, and the rubric seems to place a premium on well-written documentation. 

##Things to do to 'meet specification'

* Better README: steps to run and play the game

##Ideas to 'exceed specification'

* Selectable difficulty levels with title screen
* Timed game and score system
* Gems
* Sound effects
* Selectable characters

##DONE list

* Proper collision detection (i.e. reset)
* Reset when enter water
* Player cannot move off screen
